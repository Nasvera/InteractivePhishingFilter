With the advancement in technology and the rapid growth of the internet and its awareness, the count of internet users is increasing day by day. Though it is widely accessed from all over the world, it is very tragic that it is not safe. Internet crimes are increasing day by day and hence everyone wants safe and secure browsing. The problem is one can not find a way which guarantee safe and secure browsing. Phishing is one of the prevalent technique used by attackers to breach security and steal private and confidential information. It has compromised millions of users' data. Conventionally there are few methods such as "Blacklist" method which are being used to prevent phishing. None of these techniques or methods which has been implemented till now has given a satisfactory solution. In reference to such big issue, our goal is to come up with a solution and implement it to gain reasonable accuracy for phishing detection. We will be using machine learning algorithm and approximate string matching methods to come up with a filter/add-on that will provide safe and secure browsing to end user.
